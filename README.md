# Secure-Payment-Gateway-Simulation-Testing

# 💳 Secure Payment Gateway Simulation & Testing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Secure Payment Gateway Simulation & Testing** focused on understanding how online payment systems are secured and how common security risks are identified and mitigated.

The project is **conceptual and simulation-based**, created for learning purposes without interacting with real payment systems or processing real financial data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand payment gateway architecture
- Learn security risks in online payments
- Study secure payment processing practices
- Understand basic security testing for payment systems
- Prepare for application security and VAPT roles

---
